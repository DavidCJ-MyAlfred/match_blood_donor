Blood crisis has been a serious issue in the United States. Recently, American Red Cross a humanitarian organization that provides emergency assistance, disaster relief, and disaster preparedness education in the United States issued an emergency call to address a shortage of blood across the country. The organization, which generally keeps a five day supply of all blood types on hand, had less than a three-day supply of types A and B blood and less than a two-day supply of type O. 

Given the short shelf life of blood (~40 days) and the storage conditions required to keep it intact (~40F), it becomes a difficult task to manage blood samples even if there is an increase in the amount of donors. 

Idea:

  In order to address this issue, we built an application that would make it easier for hospitals or blood banks to locate potential donors at times of emergency. 
  
Solution:

  Based on the historical data of donors, 
  1. Implement a classifcation model that classifies donor as more likely or less likely to donate based on a number of features
  2. Implement an application that allows the hospitals to provide the current requirements to the system and obtain details of donors living nearby who are more likely to donate blood
  3. Implement a solution for the hospitals to reach out to these potential donors at times of crisis
